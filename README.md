##English to Pig Latin

A Python 2 and 3 script converting English phrases to Pig Latin from an Interactive Prompt.

Works pretty nicely except some situations regarding some rules given in the Pig Latin Language Spec.

Uses general Python String methods to do more with less code.

####To-Do

1. Fix Problems with having characters in words. Example: `you?` should be `ouyay?` rather than `ou?yay`.

2. Add rules that identify the letter `y` as vowel at end of a consonant cluster.
